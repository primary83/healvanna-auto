              To maximize your experience at any electric car show, consider these practical tips that will help you get the most value from your visit.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">
              Book Test Drives in Advance
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For shows offering test drives, appointments often fill up quickly. Check the event website weeks before and reserve your spots for the vehicles you're most interested in. Arrive early on the day of your reservation to ensure you don't miss your time slot.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">
              Wear Comfortable Shoes
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This might seem obvious, but show floors are massive. You'll easily walk several miles exploring displays, and uncomfortable footwear will cut your visit short. Plan to spend a full day if the show offers enough content.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">
              Prepare Questions in Advance
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Make a list of specific questions about the vehicles you're considering. Representatives at shows can often provide detailed technical information that isn't available in marketing materials or online configurators.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">
              Don't Ignore the Small Booths
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              While the big manufacturer displays attract crowds, smaller booths often feature innovative charging solutions, accessories, and services that can enhance your EV ownership experience. Take time to explore the entire show floor.
